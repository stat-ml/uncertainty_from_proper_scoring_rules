# Predictive Uncertainty Quantification via Risk Decompositions for Strictly Proper Scoring Rules

This repository contains code for the paper "Predictive Uncertainty Quantification via Risk Decompositions for Strictly Proper Scoring Rules," submitted to NeurIPS 2024.

### Poetry
We use poetry to manage dependecies. You can find a full installation guide and their documentation [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer).

**Install poetry**

For Linux/MacOS the following line will install poetry on your system (assuming you have python3):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

**Install dependencies**

To install dependencies from pyproject.toml file run:
```bash
poetry install
```

**Run python script**

Poetry installs dependencies in special virutal env, that is located in .venv/. To run any python code snippet with it you should run:
```bash
poetry run python ...
```
e.g.
```bash
cd experiments/laplace
poetry run python main.py -f checkpoints/resnet18_ce.pth -d cifar10_one_batch -v
```

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

### Experiments
This folder contains different experiments related to the paper.
- cifar10: Contains training scripts for cifar10 dataset.
- laplace: Contains inference scripts for Laplace Redux â€“ Effortless Bayesian Deep Learning model.

### Embedding Extraction
- source/source/evaluation_utils.py: Script to extract embeddings after the ensembles are trained.

### Notebooks
Folder notebooks/ have notebooks with data analysis of experiments.
- joint_tables.ipynb: Prepares comprehensive pandas tables for both problems.
- ood_analysis.ipynb: Generates plots for the OOD problem.
- ood_visualizations.ipynb: Creates visualizations for the OOD problem.
- mis_analysis.ipynb: Generates plots for the misclassification problem.
- mis_visualizations.ipynb: Creates visualizations for the misclassification problem.

### Notes on Trained Models
Due to a supplementary material size limit of 100MB, we cannot include the trained models in this repository. However, we are ready to provide them through any resource that maintains anonymity upon request.
